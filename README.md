# ReactApp
This is a React-based web application that allows users to manage a list of users and tasks. The app provides functionalities for logging in, adding, editing, and deleting users and tasks. It interacts with a backend API(available on my github) to perform CRUD operations, and authentication is handled using JWT tokens.
